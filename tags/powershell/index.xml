      <description>One of the new YAML pipeline steps I prepared recently involved interaction with work items. I wanted to add the comments to the task (with the task ID extracted from some file). So, I created a PowerShell step that was executing Invoke-WebRequest (with try/catch logic, obviously), the process finished successfully, but nothing happened. I mean - the comments were not there. Uhmmmm, why?! The log analysis gave me a slight hint about what was wrong (as seen in the post header picture):</description>

      <description>In the third part of a series, I focus on drawing the constraints&#39; descriptions and the colours. And also a bit of PowerShell for automation.
Automating the layout extraction Previously I prepared the file with a layout by hand - I copied the CDATA content of the/DTS:Executable/DTS:DesignTimeProperties element to the XML file and saved it. It&amp;rsquo;s a tedious task, so I wrote a PowerShell script New-Diagram.ps1. It has two paths as the parameters - the package to analyse, and the output file.</description>
