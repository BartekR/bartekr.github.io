      <description>I started working with Playwright by accident. YouTube has shown me a recommendation - a short film by Nick Chapsas (yt | t) about testing user interfaces with SpecFlow and Playwright. While I admire the SpecFlow, BDD and Gherkin ideas - I still haven&amp;rsquo;t convinced myself to use them. But Playwright + C# have drawn my attention. Then I found a webinar recording with Andrey Lushnikov, and I was sold on Playwright.</description>
