      <description>When you deploy SSIS project basically you have two options - right click on project name and standalone tool (let&amp;rsquo;s skip SMO and stuff). Both mean the same: IsDeploymentWizard.exe. I was curious what happens during deployment and why mode/Silent finishes deployment very quickly, so I started digging.
First I prepared sample SSIS project. Nothing extraordinary - just 5 packages, 6 project parameters and no connection managers (who needs them anyway?). Each package contained empty Data Flow Task - so you see that all just to compile something more than a single package.</description>
