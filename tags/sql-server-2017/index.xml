      <description>During the upcoming SQLDay 2018 conference (10th edition of SQLDay!) I&amp;rsquo;ll be speaking about testing SSIS packages and projects. From my observations, I see that we don&amp;rsquo;t like testing (I&amp;rsquo;m talking about database and ETL people), but when we start doing it - it becomes a natural part of our work. In my current project, we started slow, with some data quality testing for some parts of the process. Today you can hear &amp;ldquo;let&amp;rsquo;s write a test for it&amp;rdquo;, and it&amp;rsquo;s just a regular part of the process.</description>

      <description>Excellent! I wanted to, and after few trials and errors I finally did! And it&amp;rsquo;s pretty easy (as with all things you know when you learn it). For a start I will warn you a bit - SSISDB isn&amp;rsquo;t the database you just backup on one server and restore on another. There are some more steps to do.
The same procedure will work for migrations from version 2012 to 2017 or 2016 to 2017, I didn&amp;rsquo;t check (yet) 2014 to 2017.</description>

      <description>Recently I attended the AppDev PASS Virtual Group webinar about graphs in SQL Server 2017. When the demo about car manufacturing structure appeared in Power BI (49th minute of the recording - using Force-directed graph plugin) the idea struck: how about visualising SSIS packages&#39; relations using graphs and Power BI?
Maybe it won&amp;rsquo;t work, maybe there are limitations I&amp;rsquo;m not aware right now, but I have to try. This post will serve as the gateway to the series of post where I will write about my findings on graphs in SQL Server, their visualisations, querying, structure defining, Power BI embracement and - of course - SSIS.</description>
