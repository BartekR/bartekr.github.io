      <description>Recently, when I was using Terraform to provision virtual network structure, I had to find a solution to create 4 predefined subnets within a given network range. Initially - as PoC - I used string manipulation to obtain the ranges, but I haven&amp;rsquo;t liked it. Then I found two built-in terraform functions, that are a great help when working with network aspect: cidrsubnet and cidrsubnets.

      <description>When I build infrastructure in Azure, I use terraform. I can&amp;rsquo;t force myself to use ARM templates, and I&amp;rsquo;m not yet convinced to use bicep. Terraform has flaws and problems, and HCL is not that intuitive initially, but after banging my head against the wall, we became friends.
Yet, some time ago, when I saw Pulumi on DevOpsLab - I knew I would have to try it. Using C# to create infrastructure was something I wanted to do a while ago with Farmer and F#.</description>
