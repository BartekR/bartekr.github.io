        <description>&lt;img src="https://blog.bartekr.net/2020/11/01/migrating-to-github-pages/images/GitHubPages.png" alt="Featured image of post Migrating to GitHub Pages" /&gt;&lt;p&gt;I blog with WordPress since the 17th of February 2009. At first, I used a blog-as-a-service approach, as I wanted just to start writing and see how it goes, not building all the infrastructure. I was writing for myself, to document interesting things I found during my adventures with SQL Server.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, in 2017 I decided to switch to an English blog. I wanted to do the next step, and as I was helping run other WordPress-based websites, I started my own hosted blog – again using WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the next three years (and a half) I got fed up with it. All the interface changes, plugins updates ruining the websites, the editor that started to hamper instead of help in writing – I started looking for alternatives. The best, if it would support MarkDown, as I write almost all my documents and notes using .md files *).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I found GitHub Pages. I’ve read some comments, tutorials about migration, using Jekyll and all that stuff, but decided to go with Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It will take some time to migrate all the things to a new format. So I will do a two-step process: prepare a new blog post using Hugo, and then I will start migrating the content. Because I know if I start with the migration it will take a lot of time until I will have written a new blog post. And I already work on a few new posts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There’s also an additional benefit. In June 2020 I started a new work and the new path of the “DevOps Engineer”. I don’t like this title, as for me DevOps == TeamWork, but that’s the title I got. I prefer to call myself “the one that works towards automating the stuff”, but it does not sound as fancy as “DevOps Engineer”. But to the point – I want to know better automation mechanisms behind the GitHub, so it’s also a great way to force myself to learn more about automation outside of the Azure stack.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So – that’s it. I wish myself luck to finish the transition until the end of 2020.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Fingers crossed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;*) I write mostly in VSCode + Markdown Preview Enhanced plugin, but also I use Obsidian and Zettlr for my private notes. Also – for learning – I use RemNote. Not exactly markdown based, but since I started investing more time in learning how to learn - it really helps me to understand and learn better.&lt;/p&gt;
