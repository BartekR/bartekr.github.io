      <description>I blog with WordPress since the 17th of February 2009. At first, I used a blog-as-a-service approach, as I wanted just to start writing and see how it goes, not building all the infrastructure. I was writing for myself, to document interesting things I found during my adventures with SQL Server.
Then, in 2017 I decided to switch to an English blog. I wanted to do the next step, and as I was helping run other WordPress-based websites, I started my own hosted blog â€“ again using WordPress.</description>
