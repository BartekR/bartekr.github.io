      <description>When I switched to Hugo, I knew my new blog would not have the comments enabled. I planned it &amp;ldquo;for later&amp;rdquo;, as I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to use Disqus (available by default in Hugo).
When I chose the hugo-future-imperfect-slim theme, I saw I could integrate Staticman, which creates the comments as the Pull Request in GitHub. Brilliant idea, but it involves some additional setup (either authorising Staticman GitHub account or hosting an own API instance).</description>

      <description>Decision was made. And announced. And deadline set - so I will look stupid if I don&amp;rsquo;t do it. Something that was a strong decision started weakening. But setting a goal, and telling your friends about it is a strong motivator. Not to mention the WordPress annoyances during the transition period.
First hurdles I chose Hugo by accident. At first I wanted to use Jekyll - I worked with Ruby long time ago and thought it might be a good idea to return to those times and refresh knowledge a bit.</description>
