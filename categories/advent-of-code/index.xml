      <description>This year I took part in &amp;ldquo;Advent of Code&amp;rdquo; - a challenge with the series of puzzles to solve using any programming language. I tried two years ago but resigned after the first day. This year was different, as we set the internal leaderboards, and I had a motivation to test my skills. My initial idea was to use only the PowerShell, but after some talks, I thought &amp;ldquo;maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a good moment to start learning go lang&amp;rdquo;?</description>
