      <description>This year I took part in &amp;ldquo;Advent of Code&amp;rdquo; - a challenge with the series of puzzles to solve using any programming language. I tried two years ago but resigned after the first day. This year was different, as we set the internal leaderboards, and I had a motivation to test my skills. My initial idea was to use only the PowerShell, but after some talks, I thought &amp;ldquo;maybe it&amp;rsquo;s a good moment to start learning go lang&amp;rdquo;?</description>

      <description>An assignment: using data from the Excel file (sample data below) insert them into TFS (on-premises). Automatically. Start. You have three months from now. Or a few hours.
The original spreadsheet contains 16 records - the header and 15 tasks with 11 columns (skipped here, 8 is enough).
   Work item type Title Activity Area Path Assigned To Description Original Estimate Completed Work     Task Title1 Requirements Proj1\Team1 P Name1 Description 1 10 10   Task Title2 Maintenance Proj1\Team1 P Name2 Description 2 5 5    Additionally, the tasks should be assigned to the designated User Story: http://tfsserveraddress/tfs/CollectionName/ProjectName/_workitems/edit/12345 and the Sprint &amp;quot;\Current\Sprint 3&amp;quot;.</description>
