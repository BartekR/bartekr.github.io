        <p>This year I attended SQLBits for the first time. I wanted to go to the event last year, but didn&rsquo;t manage, so this time it was a must. And I have to tell you - great event in all aspects.</p>

<h2 id="first---the-content">First - the content</h2>
<p>I wanted to learn something new, or look at the things from different angle. Touch something, break and repair. So I went for the workshop by Mark Broadbent (<a href="https://tenbulls.co.uk/">b</a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/retracement">t</a>) about high availability with clusters and Always On Availability Groups. I did play with clusters before (using VirtualBox), this time we used Hyper-V and Windows Core servers what was new for me. Building from the ground up, configuring, fighting with internet connection, rebuilding machines (well, this was not in the workshop plan - I managed to destroy the virtual machine myself) - it was what I expected.</p>
<p>On the second day I went to Matt Masson&rsquo;s all-day presentation about SSIS. I&rsquo;m working a lot with ETL packages so I was curious if there is a room to improve. And I was glad to find out we are using best practices already, but also to learn some new interesting patterns to use. One of them - cascade use of OLEDB Destinations with additional File Destination for error reporting or double use of Lookup transformations - one with Full cache, one with Partial cache. And you know what was surprising? The session had no demos at all. Only slides. And I was awake all the time!</p>
<p>The next two days were full day presentations and I changed my mind few times before finally decided which session to go. Tough choice! Each time I&rsquo;ve learned something new and got some inspiration. Once I took the 400 level sessions that extended my knowledge of the subject, got to know about new things (like new query optimizer features) and sometimes I went for the things I know almost nothing about - like R language - or not interested that much - like new things in reporting. And I was not disappointed.</p>
<p><img src="images/IMG_20170407_102128-1024x575.jpg" alt="Steve Jones says Hi!"></p>
<p>If I had to select one session, that made a biggest impact on me it would be <a href="http://sqlbits.com/Sessions/Event16/Normalization_Beyond_Third_Normal_Form">Normalization beyond the third normal form</a> by Hugo Kornellis (<a href="http://sqlblog.com/blogs/hugo_kornelis/">b</a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/Hugo_Kornelis">t</a>). Very deep session with great examples about data design. I never thought about data the way that Hugo presented and it was awesome. I encourage everyone to watch it once it will be published. Not the easiest material, but worth your time, I promise.</p>
<h2 id="second---the-people">Second - the people</h2>
<p>Next thing that gets me to the conferences is the people. I want to see again the folks I&rsquo;ve met on previous conferences, get to know new friends, colleagues. All of them are great, willing to help if you have a problem. You want to talk about the issue you are currently facing in your job? Great, lets do it. You want more details about the session? You&rsquo;re welcome. Party together? No problem! Want some beer? Here you go. Talks about presentations, work matters, problems solved for clients - everything is so enriching. Have you seen this hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sqlfamily">#sqlfamily</a>? It really is a big, extraordinary family.</p>
<h2 id="third---the-party">Third - the party</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s not the main reason to go for the conference, but an excelent excuse to get to know new people by a glass of beer or something stronger. But it was not just a meeting with alcohol - pub games for people gathered by the round tables was &ldquo;bulls eye&rdquo; for me. Sometimes I didn&rsquo;t understand the questions, some of them were too specific, but almost already someone clarified what was it about. And I was amazed by the things the people knew. Maiden name of Marge Simpson? Name all the girls from &ldquo;Sex ant the city&rdquo;? Know the name of the disco hit and the performer after just few seconds? Come on! The next day - party with &lsquo;70 - &lsquo;80 disco theme. Well, although I have not seen many people dancing - the party was very relaxing. And Redgate&rsquo;s photo booth was <a href="https://www.facebook.com/pg/SQLBits/photos/?tab=album&amp;album_id=1520956957915668">under the siege</a>.</p>

<h2 id="fourth---the-sponsors">Fourth - the sponsors</h2>
<p>I always visit the sponsors. Of course, their gadgets are nice, but this time I had plenty of time to see their products. On another conferences I had about 15 minutes between sessions, so not that much time to get familiar with the product, This time was different. Longer breaks, regular sessions mixed with extended and suddenly I could see full demos and have a conversation about the products I was interested in. Also for the first time I took the folders to actually read it!</p>
<h2 id="fifth---the-venue">Fifth - the venue</h2>
<p>The only thing that didn&rsquo;t convince me were the Domes. Sometimes you could hear what is happening in another one. But the place in general was great Big rooms for the workshops, a lot of place for networking - what one could want more?</p>
<h2 id="the-takeaway">The takeaway</h2>
<p>Johann van den Brink <a href="https://twitter.com/JohanvdBrink/status/850780326725079040">asked me</a> what got me inspired during SQLBits. Few things. First - the tools that sponsors shown me are really useful. I will have to try SQLClone (by Redgate) and compare it to containers approach with Docker for testing purposes. Also LegiTest (by Pragmatic Works) looks promising for testing SSIS packages. Second - definitely will start using more Powershell tools. Andre Kamman (<a href="http://andrekamman.com/">b</a>|<a href="https://twitter.com/AndreKamman">t</a>) demonstrated how easy is to build full test lab using few lines of code with Autolab. It will be a great simplification of the proces that we went thoroughly with Mark Broadbent during the workshop. It&rsquo;s great to know how to build your cluster from scratch, but it&rsquo;s also great to simplify the proces. Also some of the SSIS design patterns I saw on Matt&rsquo;s presentation will start to use in development. What else? Some time ago I started to work more closely with testing, Hugo Kornelis inspired me to look closer at the design. So I would say it&rsquo;s like back to basics, revisited.</p>
<p>To sum things up. I really ejoyed the whole conference. If possible, I will go again next year. I&rsquo;m already sure I won&rsquo;t be disappointed.</p>
